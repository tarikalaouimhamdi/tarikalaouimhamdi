# 👋 Hi, I'm Tarik Alaoui M’hamdi

## 🚀 iOS Tech Lead & FullStack Developer | 20+ Years of Experience | Software Architect

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a seasoned developer and tech lead with 20+ years of experience crafting scalable mobile and web applications.

🎯 As a Senior Developer and Tech Lead, I have over 20 years of experience in mobile (iOS) and fullstack web development.

Fluent in the Apple ecosystem (Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, VIPER, Clean Architecture) as well as modern web stacks (Vue.js, Node.js, PHP, GraphQL), I contribute to high-stakes projects with a product-oriented approach focused on performance, quality, and scalability.

This dual expertise enables me to design end-to-end solutions—from backend to user interface—while ensuring technical consistency, seamless UX, and maintainable code.

I enjoy working within multidisciplinary teams, delivering concrete solutions, and leading the technical implementation of innovative projects.
